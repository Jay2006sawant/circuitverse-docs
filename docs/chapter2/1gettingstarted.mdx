# Getting Started with CircuitVerse User Account

While a user can browse CircuitVerse contributions and build circuit simulations without creating an account, having an account empowers users to perform various tasks, including:

1. Use the dashboard to save and manage circuit simulation files.
2. Fork live circuit contributions to explore and build upon the work of other users.
3. Share circuit simulation project files using unique URLs.
4. Collaborate with various user groups on different group projects.
5. Embed interactive circuits using an iframe within web pages and Google Slides.

## Create CircuitVerse User Account

The CircuitVerse platform supports Google, Facebook, and GitHub sign-in authentication systems to reduce the burden of login for users. Users can get started by signing in with their Google, Facebook, or GitHub Account, or creating a user account using their preferred email address.
