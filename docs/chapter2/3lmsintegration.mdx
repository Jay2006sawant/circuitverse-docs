# Integrate CircuitVerse with LMS

> You can configure an LTI-compliant learning management system (LMS) to connect to CircuitVerse so that you can import a CircuitVerse assignment for your course and access it without leaving your LMS.

> This guide will teach you how to integrate CircuitVerse with LTI-supported Learning Management Systems.

## About configuration of your LMS

You can connect a learning management system (LMS) to CircuitVerse. To connect your LMS to CircuitVerse, you must enter configuration credentials for CircuitVerse in your LMS.

**Note:** You and your students must use the same email that is associated with your LMS as the email in your CircuitVerse account. If you don't have an account, please create one at [CircuitVerse Sign Up](https://circuitverse.org/users/sign_up).

## Prerequisites

To connect the LMS with CircuitVerse, you must have at least one assignment in your CircuitVerse group that is LTI-enabled. Simply check the **Integrate with LMS** button while creating an assignment in CircuitVerse. You can also update an existing assignment to enable LTI just by checking the box **Integrate with LMS**.

## Supported LMSs

CircuitVerse supports LMSes that implement Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) standards.

- LTI version 1.0 and/or 1.1
- LTI Names and Roles Provisioning 1.X

Using LTI helps keep your information safe and secure. LTI is an industry-standard protocol, and CircuitVerse's use of LTI is certified by the Instructional Management System (IMS) Global Learning Consortium. For more information, see [Learning Tools Interoperability](https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/learning-tools-interoperability) and [About IMS Global Learning Consortium](http://www.imsglobal.org/aboutims.html) on the IMS Global Learning Consortium website.

CircuitVerse has tested the linking of assignments with the following LMSs:

- Moodle
- Canvas
- Sakai

## Common Troubleshooting

> ### Follow the steps below to solve common issues regarding the LMS integration.

#### 1. The CircuitVerse window is not loading inside the LMS.

Please first check if the credentials are correct. If all the credentials are correct, then please check your LMS host URL. If it is not a `https://` connection, either configure `SSL` in your LMS host or select the `Open Tool in a new window` option in the LMS while configuring the CircuitVerse External Tool.
