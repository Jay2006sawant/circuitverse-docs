# Best Practices for Working with CircuitVerse Simulator

1. **Build in small steps**: Let us assume you are implementing an arithmetic logic unit (ALU). Add a small functionality, then stop and test it by trying out different input values. Once you are convinced that the new functionality works, add more and repeat the cycle. If needed, work out the logic on paper with a truth table before implementing the circuitry. Implement flags as required and test their behavior in different scenarios.

2. **Mind circuit element properties**: Use the **PROPERTIES** panel wisely while designing your circuit. For example, if you are building an adder that receives eight bits as input, ensure the **BitWidth** property of the **Adder** circuit element is set to eight bits in the **PROPERTIES** panel. Similarly, any input circuit elements connected to the 8-bit adder should also be 8 bits wide. Thus, the **BitWidth** property of the **Input** circuit elements in Figure 2.57 has also been set to eight bits.

3. **Manage circuit layouts**: When building complex schematics, CircuitVerse strongly recommends editing the layouts of the subcircuits before adding wiring connections across nodes. Editing node positions after making the wiring connections may cause some wiring connections in the integrated circuit schematic to be lost.

4. **Copy-paste your circuits**: Cross-project copy-paste is supported, allowing you to include whole or partial circuits across different circuit tabs or project URLs.

5. **Annotate your circuits**: As your design goes through multiple revisions, use annotation tools available in the CircuitVerse simulator to add version numbers, dates, amendments, and team member details. Refer to [Chapter 4](/chapter4/7annotation.mdx) to learn more about annotation elements available within the CV simulator.
